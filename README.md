# TravelRecommendation

This is code for research in 'Personalized and Timed Travel Path Recommendation Based on GPS Data Using Deep Learning'.

## RNN
 - Requirements: Installation of Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib
 - For 'RNN' folder, you can either run 'RNN_test.py' file on Python IDE or run 'RNN_test.ipynb' on Jupyter Notebook.
 - Using Jupyter Notebook is recommended, for it is convenient to see the result of the code.

## Clustering
- Requirements: Installation of Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas
- For 'Clustering' folder, you can run 'Clustering_test.py' file on Python IDE or run 'Clustering_test.ipynb' on Jupyter Notebook.
- Using Jupyter Notebook is recommended, for it is convenient to see the result of the code.
